      "Anthroposophical Publications is pioneering a new publishing model: presenting documents online at the same time as hard copies are available for purchase: We are primarily (but not exclusively) concentrating on works with an Anthroposophical focus, including English translations of more than 2,500 Rudolf Steiner lectures that have never yet been translated. &#8220;Research Rudolf Steiner's works online ... buy the book to study at home.&#8221;",
      "Rudolf Steiner, The Kingdom of Childhood, 20th August, 1924: &#8220;As to whether French and German should be taught from the beginning in an English School, I should first like to say that I think this must be settled entirely on grounds of expediency. If you simply find that life is making it necessary to teach these languages, you must teach them. We have introduced French and English into the Waldorf School, because with French there is much to be learnt from the inner quality of the language, not found elsewhere, namely, a certain feeling for rhetoric which it is very good to acquire: and English is taught because it is a universal world language, and will become so more and more.&#8221;",
      "A number of translators from all over the world are volunteering their efforts, including Peter Stebbing, Frank Thomas Smith, Hanna von Maltitz, Luise M. Boeddinghaus, and Nesta Carsten.",
      "This is also a venue for Anthroposophically-oriented authors to publish original works without paying to self-publish or by entering into disadvantageous arrangements with publishers.",
      "Some volumes are currently available for purchase on Amazon and elsewhere, and we always have a number of works in process.",
      "<i>Anthroposophical Publications</i> and <i>Rudolf Steiner Publications</i> are imprints of <b>The e.Lib, Inc.</b> Our books are offered at reasonable prices made possible by print-on-demand technology.",

So how can stories with titles like &#8220;Life on Mars,&#8221; or &#8220;The Girl in the Floppy Hat,&#8221; or &#8220;To Hunt a Nazi&#8221; qualify as anthroposophical. They do not &#8212; until now. Therefore, this book is groundbreaking. You may smile at times, even laugh; other stories may cause a lump in your throat, perhaps even a tear or two. Oh, and by the way, fundamentalists are advised not to partake of this fantastical frosting on their anthroposophical cake.Here, then, are thirteen provocative, groundbreaking fictional tales for anthroposophists, and really anyone, to enjoy.

  target=\"_blank\">The Worldview of Herman Grimm, in Relation to Spiritual Science</a>:<br><br> \
 \
<p align=\"justify\" style=\"font-size: 13pt\">In content, this translation into English of Rudolf Steiner's lecture on the \
    art historian, author and researcher Herman Grimm, can be said to be a paean to Grimm's wholly original and unorthodox \
  approach to art history. Herman Grimm's work differs substantially from standard, more intellectual approaches, as \
  becomes evident from statements of Herman Grimm quoted here: \
  <br/><br/> \
  \&#8220;If, by some miracle, Michelangelo were called from the dead, to live among us again, and if I were to meet him, \
  I would humbly stand aside to let him pass: if Raphael came by, I would follow him, to see whether or not I might \
  have the opportunity of hearing a few words from his lips. With Leonardo and Michelangelo, one can confine oneself \
  to reporting what they once were in their day; with Raphael, one has to start from what he is for us today. Concerning \
  the two others, a slight veil has passed over them, but not over Raphael. He belongs among those whose growth is as yet \
  far from being at an end. We may imagine that Raphael will present ever new riddles to future generations of humanity.&#8221; \
  <br/><br/> \
  This is a lecture, given by Rudolf Steiner, entitled <i>Die Weltanschauung eines Kulturforschers der Gegenwart, Herman Grimm, \
  und die Geistesforschung</i> and contained in the volume <i>Ergebnisse der Geistesforschung</i> (Results of Spiritual Research) \
  GA 62. The series in which this lecture was given at the Architektenhaus in Berlin, may be said to underline its overall \
  importance for Rudolf Steiner: Held January 16th 1913 subsequent to a lecture January 30th on Raphael. Also known as, \
  <i>Herman Grimm, Contemporary Culture and Spiritual Developments, and Anthroposophy</i>. \
  <br/><br/> \
  This lecture is the fourth in a series of four lectures from GA 62, that are \
  newly translated by Peter Stebbing. Edited by James Stewart. \

    	"The e.Lib Community Code of Conduct \
	The FreeBSD community has always worked to be a welcoming and respectful community, and we want to ensure that doesn't change as we grow and evolve. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to: \
	• be friendly and patient, \
	• be welcoming, \
	• be considerate, \
	• be respectful, \
	• be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others, \
	• when we disagree, try to understand why. \
	This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate and participate in the community. \
	This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the FreeBSD project. This includes online chat, mailing lists, bug trackers, FreeBSD events such as the developer meetings and socials, and any other forums created by the project that the community uses for communication. It applies to all of your communication and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats, things you say, slides, videos, posters, signs, or even t-shirts you display in these spaces. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may, in rare cases, affect a person's ability to participate within them, when the conduct amounts to an egregious violation of this code. \
	If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing conduct@freebsd.org. For more details please see our Reporting Guide. \
	• Be friendly and patient. \
	• Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion or lack thereof, and mental and physical ability. \
	• Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language. \
	• Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor \
	behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the FreeBSD community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the FreeBSD community. \
	• Be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: \
	• Violent threats or language directed against another person. \
	• Discriminatory jokes and language. \
	• Posting sexually explicit or violent material. \
	• Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing"). \
	• Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms. \
	• Unwelcome sexual attention. \
	• Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. \
	• In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Persisting in such behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment. \
	• When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and FreeBSD is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of FreeBSD comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes. \
	Questions? \
	If you have questions, please feel free to contact the e.Lib Code of Conduct Committee by emailing conduct@elib.com or the e.Lib Board of Directors at board@elib.com."
